        // TryEnqueueWorkItem and DequeueWorkItem use the slot's 'gate' field for synchronization.  Because the
        // slot array is circular and there are no locks, we must assume that multiple threads can be entering each
        // method simultaneously.  If the first DequeueWorkItem occurs before the first TryEnqueueWorkItem, the
        // sequencing (and the enqueue) fails.
        //
        // The gate is a 32-bit int divided into four fields.  The bottom 15 bits (0x00007fff) are the count of
        // threads that have entered TryEnqueueWorkItem.  The first thread to enter is the one responsible for
        // filling the slot with work.  The 16th bit (0x00008000) is a flag indicating that the slot has been
        // successfully filled.  Only the first thread to enter TryEnqueueWorkItem can set this flag.  The
        // high-word (0x7fff0000) is the count of threads entering DequeueWorkItem.  The first thread to enter
        // is the one responsible for accepting (and eventually dispatching) the work in the slot.  The
        // high-bit (0x80000000) is a flag indicating that the slot has been successfully emptied.
        //
        // When the low-word and high-work counters are equal, and both bit flags have been set, the gate is considered
        // 'complete' and can be reset back to zero.  Any operation on the gate might bring it to this state.
        // It's the responsibility of the thread that brings the gate to a completed state to reset it to zero.
        // (It's possible that the gate will fall out of the completed state before it can be reset - that's ok,
        // the next time it becomes completed it can be reset.)
        //
        // It's unlikely either count will ever go higher than 2 or 3.
        //
        // The value of 'callback' has these properties:
        //   -  When the gate is zero, callback is null.
        //   -  When the low-word count is non-zero, but the 0x8000 bit is unset, callback is writable by the thread
        //      that incremented the low word to 1.  Its value is undefined for other threads.  The thread that
        //      sets callback is responsible for setting the 0x8000 bit when it's done.
        //   -  When the 0x8000 bit is set and the high-word count is zero, callback is valid.  (It may be null.)
        //   -  When the 0x8000 bit is set, the high-word count is non-zero, and the high bit is unset, callback is
        //      writable by the thread that incremented the high word to 1 *or* the thread that set the 0x8000 bit,
        //      whichever happened last.  That thread can read the value and set callback to null.  Its value is
        //      undefined for other threads.  The thread that clears the callback is responsible for setting the
        //      high bit.
        //   -  When the high bit is set, callback is null.
        //   -  It's illegal for the gate to be in a state that would satisfy more than one of these conditions.
